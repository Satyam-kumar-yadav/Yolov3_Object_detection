# Yolov3_Object_detection


Objet detection is a task in computer vision that involves identifying the presence, location, and type of one or more objects in a given photograph.

It is a challenging problem that involves building upon methods for object recognition (e.g. where are they), object localization (e.g. what are their extent), and object classification (e.g. what are they).

In recent years, deep learning techniques are achieving state-of-the-art results for object detection, such as on standard benchmark datasets and in computer vision competitions. Notable is the “You Only Look Once,” or YOLO, family of Convolutional Neural Networks that achieve near state-of-the-art results with a single end-to-end model that can perform object detection in real-time.

# Task 1 - Train and Test Data Collection

You can do this task in two ways :-

**Method 1**  
This method is the method I recommend as you can gather thousands of images and auto-generate their labels within minutes! Gathering a dataset from Google's Open Images Dataset and using OIDv4 toolkit to generate labels is easy and time efficient. The dataset contains labeled images for over 600 classes!
